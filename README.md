## Snowboarding
My hometown is Harbin, China. It's a pretty cool, actually cold, place with lots of snow. I started my snowboarding in my college years, maybe from 2017. During my gap year in New Zealand, I stayed in [Wānaka](https://www.lakewanaka.co.nz/about-wanaka/) for about two months and had great fun there. There are mountains like 


Then I spent my first entire season in Wanaka, NZ, in the chaos of 2020. It's one of the best memories of my Gap Year in New Zealand. I moved to Oslo, Norway in the beginning of 2021. It's really amazing to take a T-bane and transfer to bus 48 to get to Tryvann Vinterpark from city center in just an hour! That's the best part of Oslo in my perspective.

### Photography
Welcome to take a glimpse on my photos via ins:tintin_ji .<br/> I hope they won't disappoint you. I use Panasonic Lumix S1 camera system, a super fan of it!


### Yoga

I started yoga from Sept.,2021, following the group courses like "Yoga Flow" in the Athletica. Yoga is a bridge for me to reach and explore the inner part of my ego and find peacefulness in the fast-changing world.

### Muay Thai Mixed

Thanks for **Adrian G.** and **Aysha M.A.**'s generous help, I also started some boxing since Sept., 2021. Martial arts are something I have never experienced before, I learned so much about balancing, emotion control, self-defence and strategic competition at Nydalen.

## Then, the boring parts of me
I am a master student in University of Oslo, majoring in Economics(research path). I also do some programming...that's why I came to this wierd website and created this page...
```python3
% My coding level
print("I don't like programming.")

```
```matlab
dynare your.mod

```

## Boring but useful part
I will keep this section since I always forget how to write markdown.
