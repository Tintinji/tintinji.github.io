# Welcome to Tintin's Adventures

## Let's first start with some cool things~
This is Tintin, also 纪广远 in mandarin. I am a fun-driven guy, constantly exploring new areas and places...exploiting as well since I knew about RL^.^.

### Snowboarding
My hometown is Harbin, China. It's a pretty cool, actually cold, place with lots of snow. I didn't start snowboarding early from childhood...at that time, I was just playing around and preparing for the Gaokao later on. My first snowboarding experience dates back to February of 2018, or 2017? During the winter holiday in my college life, I hung out with my childhood mates in Nianzishan, Qiqihar, Heilongjiang, China. <br/>
Then I spent my first entire season in Wanaka, NZ, in the chaos of 2020. It's one of the best memories of my Gap Year in New Zealand. I moved to Oslo, Norway in the beginning of 2021. It's really amazing to take a T-bane and transfer to bus 48 to get to Tryvann Vinterpark from city center in just an hour! That's the best part of Oslo in my perspective.

### Photography
Welcome to take a glimpse on my photos via ins:tintin_ji .<br/> I hope they won't disappoint you. I use Panasonic Lumix S1 camera system, a super fan of it!


### Yoga

I started yoga from Sept.,2021, following the group courses like "Yoga Flow" in the Athletica. Yoga is a bridge for me to reach and explore the inner part of my ego and find peacefulness in the fast-changing world.

### Muay Thai Mixed

Thanks for Adrian G. and Aysha M.A.'s generous help, I also started some boxing since Sept., 2021. Martial arts are something I have never experienced before, I learned so much about balancing, emotion control, self-defence and strategic competition at Nydalen.
